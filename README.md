Following along with Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom

This is JLox, interpreted in Java. Following this, I will follow up with the C version and hopefully an extension of the language beyond what's provided in the book (provided I still want to continue on). 
I intend on writing a full technical overview on how the interpreter works to the best of my ability. Taking extensive notes while going through the book.
